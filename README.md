# BiPartiteMatching

## Getting Started

A matching in a [Bipartite Graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bipartite-graph/) is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges share an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges). In a maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. There can be more than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `BipartiteMatching.java`: A Java program to find the Maximal Bipartite matching.
  - `program3data.txt`: Input File
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Steps to run 

Open `BipartiteMatching.Java` and run in Java IDE. 
You will see a similar output with the given `program3data.txt` as input:

```
Anibel / Dozer
Belinda / Sassy
Clark / Tiger
Erine / Pippy
4 total matches
```
